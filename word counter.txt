The Word Counter Task involves creating a Python program that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it. The program should define a function called word_counter that takes a filename as an argument. It must use a try-except block to handle cases where the file may not be found. Inside the try block, the program should open the file in read mode and read its content, then split the content into words using the split() method. The number of words can be counted using the len() function on the list of words. The program should print the total word count. In the except block, an error message should be displayed if the file is not found. When the program is run, it will prompt the user to enter the filename. If the file exists, it will display the number of words in the file; if the file does not exist, it will show an error message.
